Translations
------------
The source language (en_US) is maintained in the repository. See the [Code](#code) section above.


Note: Sometimes, the source text (english) is modified. In such a case, the translation is reset. Transifex assume that if the original source
has changed, the translation is surely no more correct so must be done again. But old translation is not lost and you can use the tab "History"
to retreive all old translation of a source text, and restore the translation in one click with no need to retranslate it if there is no need to.
